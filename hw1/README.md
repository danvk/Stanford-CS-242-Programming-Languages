# Homework 1: SKI Calculus

Implementing the rewrite rules was surprisingly easy.

Running the abstraction algorithm by hand was very hard. I found it incredibly easy to make mistakes, especially because the grouping could be unintuitive (it's left-associative). I eventually got frustrated and implemented abstraction in code, which I found much easier.

Part three was fun but the connection between numpy and Combinator Calculus wasn't entirely clear to me.
